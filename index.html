        <h2>Founder: Pat Smith</h2>
          <p id="founder">
            Pat has lived her whole life in the Pacific Northwest, in a small city called Gold Bar. Her father worked as a fisherman for some surrounding restuarants and her mother stayed at home raising her and her siblings. While her father tried to support his family as much as possible, they did have some hard times. They were forced to eat a lot of salmon when her father wasn't able to sell that much.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p id="founder">
            Pat and her mom loved to expirment with recipes, they began to look for ways that they could use as much of the leftover salmon as possible. Pat began playing with the idea of making some sort of desert with them. One day she discovered that if she could grind the salmon up really fine she could use it as a binder for her cookies and the best part? You couldn't even taste the salmon!
